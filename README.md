Some information on the exam:
- There are four questions and all need to be attempted
- A rough rule of thumb is one mark per minute (with 20 over for reading/checking). Please think of this when answering any description/discussion questions to gauge the level of detail you give. 
- Questions involve a mix of interpretation, discussion and description of methods. Questions will tend not to involve extensive calculations. 
- Exam questions can cover a mix of topics but will tend to be dominated by a single topic.
